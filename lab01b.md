# this repo talking about what i learned today
here is what i learned by **markdown** :
1. header size
2. generating lists

   - unordered list

3. adding links
1. markdown care about content more than the structure
5. by generating list number doesn't metter .

growth mindset mean **for me** :

it is new thinking way to improve my *life* to be more profissional
- in my carrier
- dealing with challange
- learn from my fault
- depending on myself

**just always remember** 
1. ### always remember there is no body born know  every thing 
1. ### there in no one smarter than any one *there is only who working hard and correctly*
1. ### if you didn't arrive yet you **will** just think correctly and keep working
