# Structure
In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document

**HTML elements** :  made up of characters that live inside angled brackets
HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages

**Attributes** : Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element.

**DOCTYPEs** : there are many for every version of html , we use < !DOCTYPE html> for html 5

**Comments in HTML** : < !--we put the comment here if we want to be not visible in the user's browser -->

**ID Attribute** :  It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

  for example : < p id="pullquote">we put the unique text here</ p>

**Class Attribute** : used if we want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. 

  for example : < p class="time"> the text that we want to do many time </ p>

**Block Elements** : 
  > to  make a list of elements we use to create it < ul>< li>the eleamnt we want to use  as much we want</ li></ ul>   
  > or  < ol>< li>the eleamnt we want to use  as much we want</ li></ ol>

**Inline Elements** : Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements
   > we use < em> tag for it . 

**Grouping Text & Elements In a Block** : The < div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box

**Grouping Text & Elements Inline** : The < span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the < div> element.

**IFrames** : < iframe> iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page.

**Information About Your Pages** : The < meta> element lives inside the < head> element and contains information about that web page.

**Traditional HTML Layouts** : For a long time, web page authors used < div> elements to group together related elements on the page
**New Html5 Layout Elements** : HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. 
the name | the tag
----------- | -------
Headers & Footers  | < header> < footer>     Navigation  | < nav>                  
Articles  | < article>             
Asides   |   < aside>               
Sections  |   < section>             
Heading Groups |   < hgroup>              
Figures |   < figure> < figcaption> 
Sectioning Elements|  < div>                 

Linking Around Block-Level Elements : HTML5 allows web page authors to place an < a> element around a block level element that contains child elements.
