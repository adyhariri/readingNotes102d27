# Read: 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

### _______________________________

## HTML Links:

- Links are created using the `<a>` element.
- The `<a>` element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field, ***mailto:***.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

### _______________________________

## CSS Layout

- `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

### _______________________________

## JS Functions

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
