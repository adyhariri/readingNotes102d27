# Read: 02 - HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

## HTML Text:

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

## CSS Introduction

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
